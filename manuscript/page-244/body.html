<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">To-night—true, I ought to<br>start—but—how leave you now that I feel your heart is touched! Hard by, in<br>the Rue d'Orleans, is a convent founded by Father Athanasius, the syndic of<br>the Capuchins. True that no layman may enter—but—I can settle that with the<br>good Fathers! Their habit sleeves are wide enough to hide me in. 'Tis they<br>who serve Richelieu's private chapel: and from respect to the uncle, fear the<br>nephew. All will deem me gone. I will come to you, masked. Give me leave to<br>wait till tomorrow, sweet Lady Fanciful!</p><p>ROXANE:<br>But, of this be rumored, your glory. . .</p><p>DE GUICHE:<br>Bah!</p></div> </div>
