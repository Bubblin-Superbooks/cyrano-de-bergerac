This very night, beloved; and I<br>Feel my soul heavy with love untold.<br>I die! No more, as in days of old,<br>My loving, longing eyes will feast<br>On your least gesture—ay, the least!

Ah me! I know that gesture well!  
My heart cries out!—I cry "Farewell"!'</p><p>ROXANE:<br>But how you read that letter! One would think. . .</p><p>CYRANO (continuing to read):<br>'My life, my love, my jewel, my sweet,<br>My heart has been yours in every beat!'</p><p>(The shades of evening fall imperceptibly.)</p></div> </div>
