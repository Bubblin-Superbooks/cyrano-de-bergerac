Bertrand the fifer!—you were shepherd once,—<br>Draw from its double leathern case your fife,<br>Play to these greedy, guzzling soldiers. Play<br>Old country airs with plaintive rhythm recurring,<br>Where lurk sweet echoes of the dear home-voices,<br>Each note of which calls like a little sister,<br>Those airs slow, slow ascending, as the smoke-wreaths<br>Rise from the hearthstones of our native hamlets,<br>Their music strikes the ear like Gascon patois!. . .<br>(The old man seats himself, and gets his flute ready):<br>Your flute was now a warrior in durance;<br>But on its stem your fingers are a-dancing<br>A bird-like minuet! O flute! Remember<br>That flutes were made of reeds first, not laburnum;<br>Make us a music pastoral days recalling—<br>The soul-time of your youth, in country pastures!. .</p></div> </div>
