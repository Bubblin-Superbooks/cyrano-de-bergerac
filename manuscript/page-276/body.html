<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">lonely,—<br>Hear some gay echo of the joy I bought you!  
Each glance of thine awakes in me a virtue,—<br>A novel, unknown valor. Dost begin, sweet,<br>To understand? So late, dost understand me?<br>Feel'st thou my soul, here, through the darkness mounting?<br>Too fair the night! Too fair, too fair the moment!  
That I should speak thus, and that you should hearken!  
Too fair! In moments when my hopes rose proudest,<br>I never hoped such guerdon. Naught is left me<br>But to die now! Have words of mine the power<br>To make you tremble,—throned there in the branches?<br>Ay, like a leaf among the leaves, you tremble!  
You tremble! For I feel,—an if you will it,<br>Or will it not,—your hand's beloved trembling<br>Thrill through the branches, down your sprays of jasmine!</p></div> </div>
