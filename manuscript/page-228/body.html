'Nay, 'tis so!' when suddenly<br>he shows me these two long-shanks, whom he takes about with him as an escort,<br>and who are skillful in scratching lute-strings with their skinny claws! 'I<br>will wager you a day's music,' says he!—And lost it! Thus, see you, till<br>Phoebus' chariot starts once again, these lute-twangers are at my heels,<br>seeing all I do, hearing all I say, and accompanying all with melody.</p></div> </div>
